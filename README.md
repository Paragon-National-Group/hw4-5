# Tasks
A skeleton is provided for each task, and your job is to fill it out. The parts where you need to fill it out is marked as "TODO".

**graph class**

This class includes all the functions needed for a graph, including \__init__, addVertex, getVertices, edges, AddEdge, and findedges. Fill these functions out and add more functions if needed.

**cheapestflight**

This function takes in n (the number of cities), flights (a list of an int list showing the edges of the graph in the format [src, dst, price]), src (the starting city), dst (the destination), and K (the number of max stops). It outputs the cheapest price and outputs -1 if there is no such route.

# Submitting the Code
To submit your code, simply run the following steps:
```
git add PNG_HW4+5.py
```
```
git commit -m 'Submitted hw4+5'
```
